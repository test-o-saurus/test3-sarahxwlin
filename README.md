# **Lab 1 Part 1: Hello Java**

Course: CS122 Fall 2025  
Professor: Sarah Lin  
Date: September 8, 2025  
Class Time: 10:05 AM \- 12:05 PM

### **A Note from the Professor**

Hello everyone. My apologies, but I am unable to be there with you in person today as I am at the hospital getting an IV and won't be able to make it to class. However, learning doesn't stop\! This activity will serve as Part 1 of our first lab. The purpose is to ensure you all have a good foundation from the reading before we put this knowledge into actual practice during our next class.

### **Objective**

Welcome to your Lab 1 Part 1\! The goal of today's session is to build a strong foundation in the Java programming language. This requires you to read Chapter 1 critically to understand fundamental concepts like Java's basic syntax, the structure of a simple program, and the process of compiling and running your code. A deep understanding of these foundational ideas will be essential for our next class when we begin writing our own programs.

### **Instructions**

1. **Critical Reading:**  
   * For the first part of the class, your task is to read Chapter 1 of the textbook. (If you don't know what it is, check the syllabus. You can download a free PDF).  
   * Your goal is not to memorize, but to understand the *relationships* between concepts. For example, how does the idea of a "high-level language" lead to the need for a "compiler"?  
2. **Analysis & Application:**  
   * For the second part of the class, answer the questions in the sections below.  
   * **Professor's Note:** These questions are specifically designed to be less/un-googleable. They require you to demonstrate your unique understanding of the chapter's content. Your answers should be a product of your own critical thinking, making them distinct from your classmates' work. You must be finished by the end of our scheduled class time. You will lose write access after 12:05 PM EST as this is the deadline for today's lab.

### **Part 1: Code Comprehension & Prediction**

*(These questions test your ability to interpret Java's rules and predict outcomes.)*

**1\. Output Formatting:** Using what you learned about System.out.print and escape sequences in Section 1.7, write a **single line** of Java code that produces the following two-line output:

First line.  
    Second line is indented.

**2\. Compile vs. Run:** Look at Figure 1.3, which shows the process of compiling and running a Java program. Imagine you have a Hello.java file but you accidentally delete the Hello.class file.

* What would happen if you tried to run the command java Hello? Why?  
* What would happen if you then ran the command javac Hello.java?

3\. Error Prediction: Consider this correct line of code from the "Hello World" program: System.out.println("Hello, World\!");  
What kind of error do you think the compiler would report if you removed the semicolon ; from the end of the line? Explain in your own words why a missing semicolon would be a problem for the compiler.

### **Part 2: Conceptual Synthesis & Application**

*(These questions require you to connect ideas and apply them in new contexts.)*

**1\. Compiler vs. Interpreter:** In your own words, explain the main difference between a compiler and an interpreter based on the descriptions in Section 1.4. Why does the chapter state that compiled programs often run faster?

**2\. Simple Algorithm:** Imagine you need to create a simple program that asks a user for their favorite number. Using the basic instruction types from Section 1.2 (input, output, math, decision, repetition), list the simple steps your program would follow. For each step, identify which instruction type it is. (You do not need to write code).

**3\. The Programmer's Memo:** On page 8, the textbook shows two versions of a Goodbye program that work identically but are formatted differently. Imagine you are the lead programmer on a team. Write a brief memo to your team arguing why one of the formatting styles is superior for a project, using the reasoning provided in the chapter to support your case.

### **Submission Instructions**

Follow the same GitHub workflow you learned in Lab 0 to submit your answers.

**Step 1: Accept the Assignment**

1. Navigate to the GitHub Classroom link for this lab: https://classroom.github.com/a/X_EsUQIZ  
2. You will be prompted to accept the "Lab 1 Part 1" assignment. If you have not yet linked your GitHub account to the class roster, you will be asked to find your name on the list. Please make sure you select your name to link it to your account.  
3. Click the green **Accept this assignment** button.  
4. GitHub will take a few moments to create your personal assignment repository. Please wait for it to complete.  
5. Once it's ready, a new link to your repository will appear. Click on it to go to your assignment. You are now in your own private copy of the lab repository\!

Step 2: Add Your Answers to the Repository  
You need to add a file containing your answers to the questions above. You have two options:

* **Option A: Create a Markdown File (Recommended)**  
  * In your repository on GitHub, click **Add file \> Create new file**.  
  * Name the file answers.md.  
  * You can use Markdown to format your answers cleanly. For example:  
    \# Lab 1 Answers \- \[Your Name\]
